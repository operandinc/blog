Hey there, was a busy week, mostly working on some behind-the-scenes stuff preparing for an upcoming launch.

In general, we:

- Added support for `.docx`, `.doc`, `.pptx`, `.csv` and `.xlsx` files (beta)
- Revamped GitHub and Linear integrations
- Bug fixes / improvements

### More file types

We've gotten a few requests so far for more file types, specifically, Microsoft Office files. In response, we've added initial support for the following file types:

- `.docx`
- `.doc`
- `.pptx`
- `.csv`
- `.xlsx`

We're still working on improving the overall experience for these file types, but we wanted to get them out there as soon as possible to let you try them out, and give us feedback on how we can improve the processing of these files.

### GitHub and Linear integrations

We've improved our existing GitHub and Linear integrations, specifically, switching over to a webhook-based approach for both of them. This means that updates will be synced to Operand in near real-time.

We're slowly doing the same for other smart folders, as well as adding support for more integrations in general soon!

### Bug fixes / improvements

- Added email aliases, i.e. the ability for users to add more than one email address
- Fixed deleting of large folders (they previously timed out)
- A number of behind the scenes improvements to indexing and reliability
- Initial support for notifications (more on this soon!)
